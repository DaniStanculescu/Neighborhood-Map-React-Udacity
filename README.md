	*For redering the map , you need a key, I put my own key but if you want to use your key you can go to 

'https://console.developers.google.com/projectselector/apis/dashboard' and generate you own key , and after that you should go to src/app.js

open the file and then  down  the page where is the link for google maps  , search for the key parameter in the url and replace my key with

 your own 
 
 *I've used Wikipedia API to get informations about locations on the map
